The new printer was jammed, again.

这可是台全新的打印机！怎么又卡纸了？
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Richard M. Stallman, a staff software programmer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI Lab), discovered the malfunction the hard way. An hour after sending off a 50-page file to the office laser printer, Stallman, 27, broke off a productive work session to retrieve his documents. Upon arrival, he found only four pages in the printer's tray. To make matters even more frustrating, the four pages belonged to another user, meaning that Stallman's print job and the unfinished portion of somebody else's print job were still trapped somewhere within the electrical plumbing of the lab's computer network.

理查德·M·斯托曼（Richard M. Stallman）刚刚发现了这问题，这可苦了他了。他当年27岁，是麻省理工学院人工智能实验室的一名程序员。一个小时前，他给那台激光打印机提交了一个50页的打印任务，之后就忙着干活去了。这会他站在那台打印机那儿，眼巴巴地看着它被纸卡住：总共才打印了的四页纸，还没有一页是自己的。换句话说，理查德那份50页的文件，外加别人的半份文档，全被一张纸卡住了，成了实验室网络上的两个孤魂野鬼。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Waiting for machines is an occupational hazard when you're a software programmer, so Stallman took his frustration with a grain of salt. Still, the difference between waiting for a machine and waiting on a machine is a sizable one. It wasn't the first time he'd been forced to stand over the printer, watching pages print out one by one. As a person who spent the bulk of his days and nights improving the efficiency of machines and the software programs that controlled them, Stallman felt a natural urge to open up the machine, look at the guts, and seek out the root of the problem.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
干程序员这行也是有风险的：你总得等着机器干活。不过理查德还是能苦中作乐。可再怎么说，等着机器干活，和在它跟前盯着它干活毕竟是两码事。就说现在吧，理查德正盯着打印机，看它慢吞吞地一页一页往外吐纸。这情景对他来说可不陌生。理查德好歹也是个程序员，成天都在改进机器和程序，提高它们的效率。当下，他恨不得掀开这台打印机，仔细查查究竟是哪出的毛病。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Unfortunately, Stallman's skills as a computer programmer did not extend to the mechanical-engineering realm. As freshly printed documents poured out of the machine, Stallman had a chance to reflect on other ways to circumvent the printing jam problem.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
可惜，凭编程的能耐，没法解决机械工程的问题。斯托曼只能在重新打印文件的这会功夫，想点别的：能不能用别的办法，绕道解决这个卡纸的问题呢？

How long ago had it been that the staff members at the AI Lab had welcomed the new printer with open arms? Stallman wondered. The machine had been a donation from the Xerox Corporation. A cutting edge prototype, it was a modified version of 
\ifdefined\vone
the popular
\fi
\ifdefined\vtwo
a fast
\fi
Xerox photocopier. Only instead of making copies, it relied on software data piped in over a computer network to turn that data into professional-looking documents. Created by engineers at the world-famous Xerox Palo Alto Research Facility, it was, quite simply, an early taste of the desktop-printing revolution that would seize the rest of the computing industry by the end of the decade.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
这台打印机来人工智能实验室有多久了？斯托曼努力的回忆着。这机器是施乐公司（Xerox Corporation）捐赠的。它可是新一代产品的原型，是从上一代的复印机改进而来。和上一代比，它不再是简单地复印，而是从网络上接收数据，打印成专业品质的文档。它诞生于著名的施乐帕罗奥多研究中心（Xerox Palo Alto Research Facility）。再过大约十年，将会发生一场打印机革命，那时，许多计算机厂商都会投身其中。而这款打印机则是这场革命的先行者。

Driven by an instinctual urge to play with the best new equipment, programmers at the AI Lab promptly integrated the new machine into the lab's sophisticated computing infrastructure. The results had been immediately pleasing. Unlike the lab's old laser printer, the new Xerox machine was fast. Pages came flying out at a rate of one per second, turning a 20-minute print job into a 2-minute print job. The new machine was also more precise. Circles came out looking like circles, not ovals. Straight lines came out looking like straight lines, not low-amplitude sine waves.

人工智能实验室的程序员们，本能般地喜欢折腾这些新酷产品。当初他们麻利地把这打印机请回来，把它和实验室中的各种复杂的计算设备连在了一起,结果甚是喜人。比起以前的打印机，这台新打印机打印速度飞快。平均大约一秒钟打印一页纸。以前要花二十来分钟打印的东西，如今两分钟就解决了。新机器的打印精度也更高了。让它给画个圆，它决不会给你打出个鸡蛋；让它画条直线，它也绝不会给你拐着弯瞎划拉。

It wasn't until a few weeks after its arrival that the machine's flaws began to surface. Chief among the drawbacks was the machine's inherent susceptibility to paper jams. Engineering-minded programmers quickly understood the reason behind the flaw. As a photocopier, the machine generally required the direct oversight of a human operator. Figuring that these human operators would always be on hand to fix a paper jam, if it occurred, Xerox engineers had devoted their time and energies to eliminating other pesky problems. In engineering terms, user diligence was built into the system.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
可没过几周，这机器的缺点就逐渐显现了。其中最要命的，就是卡纸问题。凭着工程师的直觉，程序员们很快就洞察出了这问题背后的诱因。这台打印机是在复印机的基础上设计的。倘若是一台复印机，它旁边总会站个人直接操作它。遇到卡纸问题，这个人总能立即发现，着手解决，不至于有什么大影响。用工程师的行话讲，这系统需要用户参与。所以，对于复印机来说，卡纸问题也就没人关注了。设计复印机的时候，施乐公司的工程师们都没把卡纸的事情放在心上，专心去对付其他问题了。可把类似的机械部件用在打印机上，问题就来了。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
%% v1v2
In modifying the machine for printer use, Xerox engineers had changed the user-machine relationship in a subtle but profound way. Instead of making the machine subservient to an individual human operator, they made it subservient to an entire networked population of human operators. Instead of standing directly over the machine, a human user on one end of the network sent his print command through an extended bucket-brigade of machines, expecting the desired content to arrive at the targeted destination and in proper form. It wasn't until he finally went to check up on the final output that he realized how little of the desired content had made it through.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
施乐公司在复印机的基础之上，设计了这个打印机。这个小小的变化，却使得人机关系发生了微妙而深刻的改变。现在，在同一时刻，这机器不再只服务于一个用户。它要同时给整个网络的用户提供打印服务。这些用户也不再老老实实地站在机器前面，而是坐在网络的另一端，隔着老远，向这台机器发布打印命令，指望它能按要求完成任务。等这些用户回过神，想起去取打印的文件那会，他们才发现，大半的内容都被一页纸卡住出不来了。
\fi

%% v1v2
Stallman himself had been of the first to identify the problem and the first to suggest a remedy. Years before, when the lab was still using its old printer, Stallman had solved a similar problem by opening up the software program that regulated the printer on the lab's PDP-11 machine. Stallman couldn't eliminate paper jams, but he could insert a software command that ordered the PDP-11 to check the printer periodically and report back to the PDP-10, the lab's central computer. To ensure that one user's negligence didn't bog down an entire line of print jobs, Stallman also inserted a software command that instructed the PDP-10 to notify every user with a waiting print job that the printer was jammed. The notice was simple, something along the lines of "The printer is jammed, please fix it," and because it went out to the people with the most pressing need to fix the problem, chances were higher that the problem got fixed in due time.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
在这台打印机之前，斯托曼也遇到过卡纸问题，他也是实验室里第一个提出解决方案的人。几年前，实验室还用着一台旧打印机，也有类似的问题。这台打印机的控制程序，运行在实验室里的一台PDP-11计算机上。那会儿，斯托曼修改了这个控制程序，解决了这个问题。
当然，他没法直接修理打印机来解决卡纸的问题。不过他能修改控制程序，让它定期检查打印机是否工作正常，再把检查结果传给实验室的核心计算机
——
一台PDP-10。生怕哪个粗心用户忘了去查看打印机，理查德还让控制程序在卡纸的时候，向所有等待打印任务的用户发送一条提醒消息。消息简短明确：``打印机被卡住了，请去维修。''收到这消息的人都是等着要用打印机的，所以问题就迎``人''而解。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
As fixes go, Stallman's was oblique but elegant. It didn't fix the mechanical side of the problem, but it did the next best thing by closing the information loop between user and machine. Thanks to a few additional lines of software code, AI Lab employees could eliminate the 10 or 15 minutes wasted each week in running back and forth to check on the printer. In programming terms, Stallman's fix took advantage of the amplified intelligence of the overall network.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
斯托曼这解决方案虽然治标不治本，但却也算讨巧。它没解决打印机机械部件的问题，却提出了一个次优方案：完善人机交互，及早报告问题。多亏了斯托曼加的几行代码，人工智能实验室的员工，不用再跑来跑去地查看打印机状态了。这样，每周起码节省了10到15分钟时间。用编程的术语讲，斯托曼的方案提高了网络的整体智能。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``If you got that message, you couldn't assume somebody else would fix it,'' says Stallman, recalling the logic. ``You had to go to the printer. A minute or two after the printer got in trouble, the two or three people who got messages arrive to fix the machine. Of those two or three people, one of them, at least, would usually know how to fix the problem.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
``你要是收到这条消息，你可就坐不住了。你多半等不及别人去解决卡纸问题。''斯托曼回忆着其中的逻辑，``你得亲力亲为，跑到打印机跟前。一两分钟之后，要是问题还没解决，就会聚来两三个人。这其中，总会有个人知道怎么修理。''

Such clever fixes were a trademark of the AI Lab and its indigenous population of programmers. Indeed, the best programmers at the AI Lab disdained the term programmer, preferring the more slangy occupational title of hacker instead. The job title covered a host of activities-everything from creative mirth making to the improvement of existing software and computer systems. Implicit within the title, however, was the old-fashioned notion of Yankee ingenuity. To be a hacker, one had to accept the philosophy that writing a software program was only the beginning. Improving a program was the true test of a hacker's skills.\endnote{For more on the term ``hacker,'' see \nameref{Appendix B}.}

Such a philosophy was a major reason why companies like Xerox made it a policy to donate their machines and software programs to places where hackers typically congregated. If hackers improved the software, companies could borrow back the improvements, incorporating them into update versions for the commercial marketplace. In corporate terms, hackers were a leveragable community asset, an auxiliary research-and-development division available at minimal cost.
\fi

这条铁律，恰恰影响着施乐这样的公司，让它们乐意把自己的产品，以及配套的软件捐赠到黑客聚

It was because of this give-and-take philosophy that when Stallman spotted the print-jam defect in the Xerox laser printer, he didn't panic. He simply looked for a way to update the old fix or " hack" for the new system. In the course of looking up the Xerox laser-printer software, however, Stallman made a troubling discovery. The printer didn't have any software, at least nothing Stallman or a fellow programmer could read. Until then, most companies had made it a form of courtesy to publish source-code files-readable text files that documented the individual software commands that told a machine what to do. Xerox, in this instance, had provided software files in precompiled, or binary, form. Programmers were free to open the files up if they wanted to, but unless they were an expert in deciphering an endless stream of ones and zeroes, the resulting text was pure gibberish.

凭着这份礼尚往来的精神，斯托曼在这台新打印机面前并不慌张。他只要找个法子，把以前那套修改
方案拿过来，修理修理这机器，或者用圈子里的话说，``黑''它一下，就万事大吉了。可是，他刚找
了找这台施乐激光打印机的软件，就碰了一鼻子灰。这打印机根本不提供软件，至少没提供任何给人读的程序代码。要知道，那个时代，大多数公司都会发布软件的源代码（一系列可供人阅读的文本文件，用于详细定义程序的行为）。可当下，施乐公司提供的程序，却只有编译好的可执行文件。程序员倒是可以打开这些文件，可打开之后看见的，全是零和一。除非他们有闲功夫，乐意去翻译这些二进制信息，否则这些东西看起来只是一堆胡言乱语。

Although Stallman knew plenty about computers, he was not an expert in translating binary files. As a hacker, however, he had other resources at his disposal. The notion of information sharing was so central to the hacker culture that Stallman knew it was only a matter of time before some hacker in some university lab or corporate computer room proffered a version of the laser-printer source code with the desired source-code files.

After the first few printer jams, Stallman comforted himself with the memory of a similar situation years before. The lab had needed a cross-network program to help the PDP-11 work more efficiently with the PDP-10. The lab's hackers were more than up to the task, but Stallman, a Harvard alumnus, recalled a similar program written by programmers at the Harvard computer-science department. The Harvard computer lab used the same model computer, the PDP-10, albeit with a different operating system. The Harvard computer lab also had a policy requiring that all programs installed on the PDP-10 had to come with published source-code files.

经历了几次卡纸事件之后，理查德还耐着性子安慰自己。不管怎么说，当初也遇到过类似情况的。几年前，实验室需要一个网络程序，让那台PDP-11和PDP-10之间协调工作。实验室里这群黑客自然能胜任这任务。不过理查德，作为一个哈佛毕业的校友，记起了当初在哈佛计算机系，有个黑客也写过类似的程序。就跑在哈佛的一台PDP-10上。那台PDP-10，和当下人工智能实验室这台一样，只是运行了不同的操作系统。哈佛的机房里有规定，要求所有安装在PDP-10上的程序，都必须发布源代码。

Taking advantage of his access to the Harvard computer lab, Stallman dropped in, made a copy of the cross-network source code, and brought it back to the AI Lab. He then rewrote the source code to make it more suitable for the AI Lab's operating system. With no muss and little fuss, the AI Lab shored up a major gap in its software infrastructure. Stallman even added a few features not found in the original Harvard program, making the program even more useful. "We wound up using it for several years," Stallman says.

%% There are programs, called ``disassemblers,'' to convert the ones and zeroes into low-level machine instructions, but figuring out what those instructions actually ``do'' is a long and hard task, known as ``reverse engineering.''  To reverse engineer this program could have taken more time than five years' worth of jammed printouts.  Stallman wasn't desperate enough for that, so he put the problem aside.

%% Xerox's unfriendly policy contrasted blatantly with the usual practices of the hacker community.  For instance, to develop the program for the PDP-11 that ran the old printer, and the program for another PDP-11 that handled display terminals, the AI Lab needed a cross-assembler program to build PDP-11 programs on the PDP-10 main computer. The lab's hackers could have written one, but Stallman, a Harvard student, found such a program at Harvard's computer lab. That program was written to run on the same kind of computer, the PDP-10, albeit with a different operating system. Stallman never knew who had written the program, since the source code did not say.  But he brought a copy back to the AI Lab. He then altered the source code to make it run on the AI Lab's Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS). With no muss and little fuss, the AI Lab got the program it needed for its software infrastructure. Stallman even added a few features not found in the original version, making the program more powerful. ``We wound up using it for several years,'' Stallman says.

From the perspective of a 1970s-era programmer, the transaction was the software equivalent of a neighbor stopping by to borrow a power tool or a cup of sugar from a neighbor. The only difference was that in borrowing a copy of the software for the AI Lab, Stallman had done nothing to deprive Harvard hackers the use of their original program. If anything, Harvard hackers gained in the process, because Stallman had introduced his own additional features to the program, features that hackers at Harvard were perfectly free to borrow in return. Although nobody at Harvard ever came over to borrow the program back, Stallman does recall a programmer at the private engineering firm, Bolt, Beranek \& Newman, borrowing the program and adding a few additional features, which Stallman eventually reintegrated into the AI Lab's own source-code archive.

Through this simple system of intellectual accretion, hackers at the AI Lab and other places built up robust creations. On the west coast, computer scientists at UC Berkeley, working in cooperation with a few low-level engineers at AT\&T, had built up an entire operating system using this system. Dubbed Unix, a play on an older, more academically respectable operating system called Multics, the software system was available to any programmer willing to pay for the cost of copying the program onto a new magnetic tape and shipping it. Not every programmer participating in this culture described himself as a hacker, but most shared the sentiments of Richard M. Stallman.

When the desired files failed to surface, however, Stallman began to grow suspicious. The year before, Stallman had experienced a blow up with a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University. The student, Brian Reid, was the author of a useful text-formatting program dubbed Scribe. One of the first programs that gave a user the power to define fonts and type styles when sending a document over a computer network, the program was an early harbinger of HTML, the lingua franca of the World Wide Web. In 1979, Reid made the decision to sell Scribe to a Pittsburgh-area software company called Unilogic. His graduate-student career ending, Reid says he simply was looking for a way to unload the program on a set of developers that would take pains to keep it from slipping into the public domain. To sweeten the deal, Reid also agreed to insert a set of time-dependent functions- "time bombs" in software-programmer parlance-that deactivated freely copied versions of the program after a 90-day expiration date. To avoid deactivation, users paid the software company, which then issued a code that defused the internal time-bomb feature.

可是眼巴巴地等着源代码，如今还没找到，倒真是让斯托曼起了疑心，勾起了他几年前的一段不快回忆。当初，一位在卡耐基梅隆大学的计算机博士，名叫布莱恩·瑞德（Brian Reid）。他开发了一个很不错的文本排版软件，名叫Scribe。这软件可以让用户通过网络传递文档并且还支持自定义的字体，这在当时可是首例。之后这种功能的普及则带来了HTML——如今WWW网络上的通用语言。1979年，布莱恩决定把Scribe出售给一家在匹兹堡的公司，名叫Unilogic。他当时刚好博士毕业，正打算把开发Scribe的任务转手给别人，免得它流落到公共版权域里。为了让这份订单更吸引人，布莱恩在Scribe中动了点小手脚：他在里面放了个“定时炸弹”，让用户有90天的免费试用期，90天一过，如果用户不交费，则不能再使用这个软件。

For Reid, the deal was a win-win. Scribe didn't fall into the public domain, and Unilogic recouped on its investment. For Stallman, it was a betrayal of the programmer ethos, pure and simple. Instead of honoring the notion of share-and-share alike, Reid had inserted a way for companies to compel programmers to pay for information access.

对于布莱恩来说，这个买卖是个双赢策略。一方面，正如布莱恩所期望的，Scribe的代码的确没有流落到公共域；另一方面，Unilogic也有了个向用户收费的途径。可这对斯托曼来说，这份交易完全是背叛了程序员的良心。布莱恩非但没遵循分享再传播的精神，而且竟然还助纣为虐，帮助公司去强制限制用户自由。

Word had it that a scientist at the computer-science department at Carnegie Mellon University had just departed a job at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.

During that visit, he made sure to stop by the computer-science department. Department employees directed him to the office of the faculty member leading the Xerox project. When Stallman reached the office, he found the professor working there.

In true engineer-to-engineer fashion, the conversation was cordial but blunt. After briefly introducing himself as a visitor from MIT, Stallman requested a copy of the laser-printer source code so that he could port it to the PDP-11. To his surprise, the professor refused to grant his request.

Memory is a funny thing. Twenty years after the fact, Stallman's mental history tape is notoriously blank in places. Not only does he not remember the motivating reason for the trip or even the time of year during which he took it, he also has no recollection of the professor or doctoral student on the other end of the conversation. According to Reid, the person most likely to have fielded Stallman's request is Robert Sproull, a former Xerox PARC researcher and current director of Sun Laboratories, a research division of the computer-technology conglomerate Sun Microsystems. During the 1970s, Sproull had been the primary developer of the laser-printer software in question while at Xerox PARC. Around 1980, Sproull took a faculty research position at Carnegie Mellon where he continued his laser-printer work amid other projects.

With both participants in the brief conversation struggling to recall key details-including whether the conversation even took place-it's hard to gauge the bluntness of Sproull's refusal, at least as recalled by Stallman. In talking to audiences, Stallman has made repeated reference to the incident, noting that Sproull's unwillingness to hand over the source code stemmed from a nondisclosure agreement, a contractual agreement between Sproull and the Xerox Corporation giving Sproull, or any other signatory, access the software source code in exchange for a promise of secrecy. Now a standard item of business in the software industry, the nondisclosure agreement, or NDA, was a novel development at the time, a reflection of both the commercial value of the laser printer to Xerox and the information needed to run it. "Xerox was at the time trying to make a commercial product out of the laser printer," recalls Reid. "They would have been insane to give away the source code."
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
当事双方谁也不记得事情的细节，甚至都无法确定是否真的发生过。至于斯托曼说的，斯布鲁硬生生地把他拒绝了，也就无从考证了。在之后的各种演讲中，斯托曼一再提及这件事。强调斯布鲁由于签署了保密协议，从而不能泄露源代码。如今在各个IT公司，签署保密协议已经非常普遍。不过在当时，为软件代码签署保密协议还算先例。这也间接地反映出施乐公司对激光打印机项目的重视程度。``

For Stallman, however, the NDA was something else entirely. It was a refusal on the part of Xerox and Sproull, or whomever the person was that turned down his source-code request that day, to participate in a system that, until then, had encouraged software programmers to regard programs as communal resources. Like a peasant whose centuries-old irrigation ditch had grown suddenly dry, Stallman had followed the ditch to its source only to find a brand-spanking-new hydroelectric dam bearing the Xerox logo.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
但在斯托曼看来，这种保密协议完全是另一回事。那会儿大家都把软件认为是一种共有的资源，卡耐基梅隆大学一些研究员的做法，就意味着否定这个公理。这对斯托曼来说，就好比是一个农夫眼看着用来灌溉庄稼的河流干枯了。循着河道往上巡查，竟然看到一道大坝从天而降，拦住河水。大坝上赫然印着几个大字：施乐公司。

For Stallman, the realization that Xerox had compelled a fellow programmer to participate in this newfangled system of compelled secrecy took a while to sink in. At first, all he could focus on was the personal nature of the refusal. As a person who felt awkward and out of sync in most face-to-face encounters, Stallman's attempt to drop in on a fellow programmer unannounced had been intended as a demonstration of neighborliness. Now that the request had been refused, it felt like a major blunder. "I was so angry I couldn't think of a way to express it. So I just turned away and walked out without another word," Stallman recalls. "I might have slammed the door. Who knows? All I remember is wanting to get out of there."

施乐公司用各种花言巧语，把一位程序员同胞带入了这片新天地，与世隔绝。不过一开始，斯托曼也没把重点集中在施乐公司那边，而是怪罪到了个人性格上。作为一个标准技术宅男，斯托曼和人沟通起来难免有点障碍。他这次亲自跑去拜访一位程序员同行，已经是一种充满诚意的行为了。而到头来
却被闷头一棍。让他实在觉得对方有点鲁莽。``我当时非常生气，都不知道怎么表达。我扭头，二话

Twenty years after the fact, the anger still lingers, so much so that Stallman has elevated the event into a major turning point. Within the next few months, a series of events would befall both Stallman and the AI Lab hacker community that would make 30 seconds worth of tension in a remote Carnegie Mellon office seem trivial by comparison. Nevertheless, when it comes time to sort out the events that would transform Stallman from a lone hacker, instinctively suspicious of centralized authority, to a crusading activist applying traditional notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity to the world of software development, Stallman singles out the Carnegie Mellon encounter for special attention.

二十多年过去了，可斯托曼当初的怨气还在。他甚至把这个事件描述为人生转折点。然而，那之后几个月中，在人工智能实验室以及斯托曼身上发生的各种事，却比这次打印机事件还令人难以接受。斯托曼，本是一名孤独的黑客，本能地对绝对权威有戒心。在经历了这一系列事件后，变成了一位斗士，把传统的自由、平等、博爱的精神引入软件开发领域。而这次的打印机事件，在其一生的无数事件中则最值得一书。

``It encouraged me to think about something that I'd already been thinking

Although previous events had raised Stallman's ire, he says it wasn't until his
Carnegie Mellon encounter that he realized the events were beginning to intrude
on a culture he had long considered sacrosanct. As an elite programmer at one of
the world's elite institutions, Stallman had been perfectly willing to ignore
the compromises and bargains of his fellow programmers just so long as they
didn't interfere with his own work. Until the arrival of the Xerox laser
printer, Stallman had been content to look down on the machines and programs
other computer users grimly tolerated. On the rare occasion that such a program
breached the AI Lab's walls-when the lab replaced its venerable Incompatible
Time Sharing operating system with a commercial variant, the TOPS 20, for
example-Stallman and his hacker colleagues had been free to rewrite, reshape,
and rename the software according to personal taste.

尽管之前也有过类似的不快经历，可这次的打印机事件，彻底让斯托曼意识到，这些一系列的事件，
正悄悄地侵蚀自己所珍视的文化---那个神圣不可侵犯的小圈子。作为一个世界顶级研究机构的顶级
程序员，斯托曼之前一直都无视那些程序员同行所作的各种妥协让步，因为他们还不至于影响到斯托
曼的工作。而如今施乐激光打印机的到来，让斯托曼开始注意到其他计算机用户一直忍受的程序和机
器。这些程序很少能影响到人工智能实验室，斯托曼和实验室的成员之前一直都可以自由地重写软件
，添加功能。直到有一天，人工智能实验室把一台计算机的操作系统从不相容分时系统（Incompatible
Time Sharing Operating System）换成了商业的TOPS 20系统，这些就再也不能做了。

Now that the laser printer had insinuated itself within the AI Lab's network,
however, something had changed. The machine worked fine, barring the occasional
paper jam, but the ability to modify according to personal taste had
disappeared. From the viewpoint of the entire software industry, the printer was
a wake-up call. Software had become such a valuable asset that companies no
longer felt the need to publicize source code, especially when publication meant
giving potential competitors a chance to duplicate something cheaply. From
Stallman's viewpoint, the printer was a Trojan Horse. After a decade of failure,
privately owned software-future hackers would use the term `` proprietary''
software-had gained a foothold inside the AI Lab through the sneakiest of
methods. It had come disguised as a gift.

如今，这台激光打印机已经强势入驻到人工智能实验室了，而外面的世界也悄悄发生了变化。除了偶尔卡纸以外，打印机工作还算正常。可是按照个人喜好修改软件则不可能了。从软件业的角度看，这打印机的出现是个信号，预示着软件是公司的重要财产。谁也不再想发布软件源代码，因为这可能会给潜在竞争对手机会，让他们可以轻松山寨自己的产品。而在斯托曼看来，这打印机简直就是个卧底。十来年的尝试，私有软件总算在人工智能实验室中站得一角。私有软件，也就是如今所说的专有软件，这次被打扮成礼物，潜入得悄无声息。

That Xerox had offered some programmers access to additional gifts in exchange
for secrecy was also galling, but Stallman takes pains to note that, if
presented with such a quid pro quo bargain at a younger age, he just might have
taken the Xerox Corporation up on its offer. The awkwardness of the Carnegie
Mellon encounter, however, had a firming effect on Stallman's own moral
lassitude. Not only did it give him the necessary anger to view all future
entreaties with suspicion, it also forced him to ask the uncomfortable question:
what if a fellow hacker dropped into Stallman's office someday and it suddenly
became Stallman's job to refuse the hacker's request for source code?

施乐公司后来还发出邀请，让一些程序员再使用它们的礼品。斯托曼说，要是再早几年，他没准也无法拒绝这种免费午餐。是那次打印机事件，让斯托曼建立起了道德防线。它不仅给了斯托曼足够的怒火，去对以后的各种礼品心存戒备；它更让斯托曼开始思考一个让他自己也坐立不安的问题：要是以后哪个黑客同行进到自己的办公室，向他索要代码，他究竟会不会拒绝拷贝代码呢？

It was a lesson Stallman would carry with him through the tumultuous years of the 1980s, a decade during which many of his MIT colleagues would depart the AI Lab and sign nondisclosure agreements of their own. Because most nondisclosure aggreements (NDAs) had expiration dates, few hackers who did sign them saw little need for personal introspection. Sooner or later, they reasoned, the software would become public knowledge. In the meantime, promising to keep the software secret during its earliest development stages was all a part of the compromise deal that allowed hackers to work on the best projects. For Stallman, however, it was the first step down a slippery slope.

斯托曼带着这种态度，经历了动荡的八十年代。在这期间，麻省理工学院的同事们纷纷离开实验室，走进公司，签署了保密协议。大多数保密协议都有解密时间，而这则成了很多黑客们的借口。他们会辩解说：软件迟早会成为公共资源。而保证软件在早期的开发阶段不被泄露，则可以保证让各位黑客朋友们可以进入到顶尖项目中工作。这些借口，在斯托曼看来，则是一切迈向深渊的第一步。

As Stallman would quickly learn, refusing such requests involved more than personal sacrifice. It involved segregating himself from fellow hackers who, though sharing a similar distaste for secrecy, tended to express that distaste in a more morally flexible fashion. It wasn't long before Stallman, increasingly an outcast even within the AI Lab, began billing himself as "the last true hacker," isolating himself further and further from a marketplace dominated by proprietary software. Refusing another's request for source code, Stallman decided, was not only a betrayal of the scientific mission that had nurtured software development since the end of World War II, it was a violation of the Golden Rule, the baseline moral dictate to do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

斯托曼很快就会明白，要拒绝这些要求和邀请，不仅需要一些个人牺牲，更会被其他一些黑客们疏远。这些黑客虽然也对各种保密协议嗤之以鼻，但却会更圆滑地对它加以评判。正因如此，斯托曼被誉为``最后的黑客''。这使他与专有软件市场渐行渐远。拒绝提供源代码，在斯托曼看来，不仅违背了二战以来深植入软件开发中的科学精神，更违背了``己所不欲，勿施于人''的道德准则。

Hence the importance of the laser printer and the encounter that resulted from it. Without it, Stallman says, his life might have followed a more ordinary path, one balancing the riches of a commercial programmer with the ultimate frustration of a life spent writing invisible software code. There would have been no sense of clarity, no urgency to address a problem others weren't addressing. Most importantly, there would have been no righteous anger, an emotion that, as we soon shall see, has propelled Stallman's career as surely as any political ideology or ethical belief.
